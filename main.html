	<h1>About Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p>In theoretical computer science, the time complexity efficient is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is usually expressed asymptotically in big O notation, such as O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), or O(n^2).</p>
