	<h1>About Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the quantification of the amount of time taken by a set of code or algorithm to process or run as a function of the amount of input. In other words, time complexity is essentially efficient, or how long a program function takes to process a given input.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm needs. The space needed by a program contains the fixed part that is independent of the size of the problem and the variable part that grows with the size of the problem. For example, simple recursive program for Fibonacci numbers takes O(n) space.</p>
